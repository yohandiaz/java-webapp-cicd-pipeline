## CI/CD Pipeline for Java Application

This repository houses the code for this project, which focuses on building and deploying a Java application using a CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

In this project, I have implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for my Java application. The pipeline incorporates a variety of tools and technologies, including GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes. 

## Features

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The CI process ensures that the codebase is regularly built, tested, and validated. Any changes made to the repository trigger the CI pipeline, providing quick feedback on code quality and identifying potential issues early on.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: The CD process automates the deployment of the application to different environments, such as staging and production. It ensures that the application is consistently and reliably deployed, reducing the chances of errors during the deployment process.

- **GitHub**: The repository is hosted on GitHub, a widely-used version control system that enables collaboration and provides a centralized location for managing the project's source code.

- **Jenkins**: Jenkins is employed as the automation server to orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline. It facilitates the integration of various tools and executes the defined stages of the pipeline automatically.

- **Maven**: Maven is used as the build automation tool to compile the source code, manage dependencies, and package the Java application. It ensures consistent and reproducible builds.

- **Docker**: Docker is utilized for containerizing the application, enabling easy deployment and portability across different environments. It allows for isolation and simplifies the management of dependencies.

- **Ansible**: Ansible plays a role in automating the deployment and configuration management of infrastructure and application components. It streamlines the provisioning process and ensures consistent deployments.

- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes serves as the orchestration platform for managing containerized applications. It automates scaling, deployment, and management, providing a robust and scalable environment.
